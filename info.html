    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        My name is John Nelson, and I'm a 55-year-old Full Stack Developer based in Rockwall, Texas. I specialize in designing, building, and deploying end-to-end web applications — from intuitive front-end interfaces to scalable back-end systems.</p><p>

I’ve worked with a wide range of technologies over the years, and I enjoy staying current as the ecosystem evolves. My focus is on writing clean, maintainable code and building applications that solve real problems, not just look impressive on the surface.</p><p>

I’m comfortable working solo or as part of a collaborative team, and I’m intentional about writing code that future developers won’t curse me for. I also mentor newer developers when I can, because good engineering culture matters just as much as good engineering.</p><p>

When I’m not working, you can probably find me refining side projects, reading up on new tooling trends, or annoying my coffee machine with “one more cup.” I believe development is equal parts craft and curiosity — and I try to bring both to every project I take on.</p>
